# INFO-H420 Management of Data Science and  Business Workflows - Project on Responsible Data Science

The goal of this project is to combine principles from responsible data science to study an ML 
pipeline. Specifically, you will study a classifier that predicts whether someone will have 
income “>50K” on the Adult data set.  The project asks you to investigate several responsible 
data science aspects of the ML pipeline.
